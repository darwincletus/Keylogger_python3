# Keylogger_python3
A keylogger is a software or hardware device that records keystrokes on a computer without the user's knowledge. In Python, a basic keylogger can be created using various modules and techniques. To create a keylogger, import the pynput module, create a listener using the pynput.keyboard module, and capture and store keystrokes. The callback function can be triggered when a key is pressed. The keylogger can be run as a background process or hidden from the user.

Advanced features can be added, such as sending captured data via email or encrypting logged information for increased security. It is crucial to use keyloggers responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and ethical guidelines.
